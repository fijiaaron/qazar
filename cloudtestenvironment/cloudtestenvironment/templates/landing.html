	<p>
	A test environment is an ephemeral thing.  It's always in flux.  New code is pushed regularly.  Requirements change unpredictably.  And test data is unreliable at best.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you're like most, your test environment is at best a poor reflection of production.  It's never stable.  It is constantly shifting beneath your feet.  And you've only got one.
	</p>

	<p>
	But the amount of work needed to create a useable test environment can be daunting.  There are hardware resources to allocate, environment configuration dependencies, security concerns, and deployment hurdles to overcome.  
	</p>

	<p>
	Continuous Delivery seems like a pipe dream.  Releases can turn into nightmares.  Agile is not delivering on it's promise of faster development.

		<h3> Do you wish you could... </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Create a stable test environment that is more like production?</h4>
				<p>
				Scale up or down (and out) your cloud environments on demand.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Deploy code to test more frequently and reliably?</h4>
				<p>
				Continuous integration &amp; deployment to multiple environments are possible in the cloud./
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Have immediate feedback on automated regression and smoke tests?</h4>
				<p>
				Run tests on every commit in a production-like environment.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Spin up a temporary copy of your app/site to explore radical changes and get customer feedback?</h4>
				<p>
				Create and destroy cloud environments on demand and pay for only what you need.
